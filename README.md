# vegas-cursor-outfade
Creates a fade(out) on the selected events from the cursor's position in Vegas Pro.
It's the twin of the vegas-cursor-infade repo, not much is changed. Use it if it's useful for you :D.
If you'd like to edit the code, don't forget to set up a reference to Vegas's ScriptPortal dll in you IDE (I mean if you want to debug).
